Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way.
 It seamlessly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages.

Scala is object-oriented.
Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. 
Types and behaviors of objects are described by classes and traits. 
Classes can be extended by subclassing, and by using a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.
